# Design-document-for-The-Gaming-Room
This is an assignment for university and the client in question is fictious in nature.

<ins>**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**</ins>

The Gaming Room is a video game development company who wanted to expand their mobile game for Android to a larger audience. The software they requested is not so much the development of a game, but modifications of their application to have the game run as a web application capable of being used on a wide range of operating systems.


<ins>**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**</ins>

I believe we had an excellent level of communication with our client and developed the documentation in tandem with what the client wanted in substantially better detail than the initial request provided. This allowed us to tailor our recommendations to truly fit their needs and wants instead of making assumptions and taking the project in a direction they may not necessarily have wanted or understood.


<ins>**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**</ins>

The compartmentalization of areas that we need to address for such requests is a great way to more thoroughly understand the clients’ needs and to communicate to them what we are doing exactly and why we are doing them.


<ins>**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**</ins>

I feel as though the section on design constraints to be the weakest part of the document. Having written this early into the course, and more importantly early into the assignment itself (or rather, this part of the assignment was part of an earlier one and the other aspects were added/expanded on later.) With that in mind, my understanding of what the design constraints truly are is much better and fleshed out as opposed to my initial thoughts.


<ins>**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**</ins>

The strategy that I executed was to design the document broadly initially and then develop the document with a more precise plan with the feedback that I requested along with each step in the development process. Repeating this strategy requesting feedback on the revisions several times not only prepares us better to develop for our clients, but also helps us provide a more satisfactory result.
While this does not necessarily affect me, or my company, in the current point in team, it is vital that I provide the best possible results when working with companies to not only improve / retain their reputation among clients, but to improve myself as a developer and increase the value of my skill.


<ins>**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**</ins>

The strategy that I employed for interpreting the user’s needs is a prime example of what I plan to employ in nearly any situation. Specifically, communication is vital toward providing clients with satisfactory results. This philosophy can be applied to one’s employment as well, even to work with much less importance.
